# Creating and Deploying a Dockerized Application on AWS EKS with GitHub Actions and Terraform

Welcome to my comprehensive guide on creating and deploying a Dockerized application on AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) using GitHub Actions and Terraform. In this tutorial, I will cover the following steps:

1. **Prerequisites**
2. **Setting up AWS EKS with Terraform**
3. **Creating a Dockerfile**
4. **Building a Docker Image**
5. **Deploying on AWS EKS with Terraform**
6. **Conclusion**

## Prerequisites
Before I begin, I need to ensure that I have the following prerequisites in place:

- An AWS account with sufficient permissions to create EKS clusters.
- Terraform installed on my local machine.
- A GitHub repository containing my application code.

## Setting up AWS EKS with Terraform
Setting up AWS EKS with Terraform involves the following steps:

1. **Install Terraform**: First, I will install Terraform on my local machine by following the instructions [here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli).

2. **Configure AWS Credentials**: I will configure my AWS credentials using the `aws configure` command to allow Terraform access to my AWS account.

3. **Initialize Terraform**: In my Terraform project directory, I will run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.

4. **Create Terraform Configuration**: I will create a `.tf` file (e.g., `eks-cluster.tf`) to define my EKS cluster configuration, including VPC, subnets, and node groups.

5. **Apply Configuration**: Then, I will execute `terraform apply` to create my EKS cluster. I will confirm the changes when prompted.

6. **Configure Kubeconfig**: After creating the cluster, I will configure my `kubeconfig` by running `aws eks update-kubeconfig` to interact with the EKS cluster.

## Creating a Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is used to package my application into a Docker image. The Dockerfile typically consists of instructions for building the image.

## Building a Docker Image
To build a Docker image for my application, I will follow these steps:

1. **Install Docker**: I will install Docker on my local machine by following the installation guide [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

2. **Navigate to My Application Directory**: I will open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing my application code and the Dockerfile.

3. **Build the Docker Image**: Then, I will execute the `docker build` command to build my Docker image. I will specify the appropriate image name and tag.

4. **Verify Image Creation**: To confirm that the Docker image was created successfully, I will run `docker images`.

## Deploying on AWS EKS with Terraform
To deploy my Dockerized application on AWS EKS with Terraform, I will follow these steps:

1. **Create Terraform Configuration**: I will set up a Terraform configuration (e.g., `eks-app-deployment.tf`) to define the resources needed for my application deployment. This may include Kubernetes deployments, services, and ingress controllers.

2. **Apply Configuration**: Next, I will run `terraform apply` to deploy my application on AWS EKS. Terraform will create the necessary resources defined in my configuration.

3. **Access My Application**: After deployment, I will use the EKS cluster's endpoint and ingress controller settings to access my application.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! I have successfully set up a workflow to create and deploy a Dockerized application on AWS EKS using GitHub Actions and Terraform. This guide has covered the essential steps, from setting up the infrastructure to automating the deployment process.
